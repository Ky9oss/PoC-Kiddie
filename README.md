# PoC Kiddle
This project is designed for continuous integration of PoCs (Proofs of Concept) verified by me, helping to quickly reproduce vulnerabilities without requiring deep understanding of their underlying principles.

# Features

- Rapid Reproduction: All PoCs have been personally tested by me in specific environments, with complete test cases provided.
- Unified Style: All PoCs are rewritten in a consistent style, including robust error handling, clear documentation, and standardized output formats.
- High-Risk Vulnerabilities: Only valuable high-risk vulnerabilities are included, intended for red team exercises rather than penetration testing.
